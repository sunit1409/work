Funny. m and the function as_per_question takes a very traditional way of solving the question, uses combinatorialarguments to solve the same , but this procedure has issues when we deal with huge values of n as the time complexity increases to exbortionrily high, but on doing so I realised that the answers that we get are following a fibonacci sequence so one more fast algorithm that can be carried out is doing a golden ration approximation, so that is done in the second attempt
type better to start the program and now enter cvalues as described by the question but it is to be noted that this is an appoximate method to the question , it is fast but is not exactly equal to the actual answer. One can make it more exact by keeping hiher values of the fibonacci sequence as the base which in this I set it to 377/233 and running the as_per_question code for values less than the set values
